    <h1>Read this to know about the webdesigner of this portifoli </h1>
    <p style="color:pink;">i am who i am first of all because Allah loves me and he loves every one who is reading this. 
        i am persuising a bachelor's of science in software engineering at makerere university and
         am in my third year alhamudulilah.
        it has really been a hard time for me to try to concentrate on coming up 
        with some serious website like one because if i remeber the times i have been trying 
        out this but then i was just loosing interest for coding on the way, 
        yet indeed i really had much love to become a software developer and everytime 
        i heard about any opportunities of training girls in coding i had to make sure that i join 
        and good enough every where i was 
        applying for the training , 
        i was given a chance but unfortunately as time could pass by i used to lose interest
         because trust me coding isnt easy as people think.
       i believe if you want to be a good coder for hiring ,
        the trust me you have to submit like 6hours of your 24hrs everyday 
        because the more you take time minus coding then you will forget .
         but all in all we should never lose hope and we can be among the website designers they hire in big companies. 
        thank you so much for your time becasue i believe i have alot to say but i cnt say it all here. love you guys.
